# Portfolio powered by Guilherme Alves de Oliveira

Welcome to my portfolio, here you can find links to my projects in Data Science and Backend development I have been working on. The purpose of these projects is to demonstrate my skills in solving business problems Python programming language.


# About my skills

I am currently looking for an opportunity to start in this area, demonstrating the skills I've achived in my post graduate degree and by doing personal projects.
I have developed regression and classification problems. The details of each one of them are below.

Analytical tools: 
- Data Collection: MySQL, Postgres.
- Data Manipulation: TensorFlow, SciPy,Pandas, Matplotlib, SciKit-Learn, etc.
- Cloud: Azure, Heroku, Render, Koyeb.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Numpy, Seaborn and Pyplot.
- Machine Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Naive Bayes, BERT, OpenAI, Llama, Hugging Face, YOLO etc.
- Data Visualization: PowerBI, Streamlit, Solana.
- DataBase: MySQL, SQL Server, Databricks(Studying)
- API: Rest, Django, Flask, FastAPI

## Projects


[Financial Analyst -> ETL](https://github.com/guialveira-professional/Financial-Analist)

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/conscienciadeinvestidor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-design-4.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

A Financial Analyst requested a tool to help in his decisions, the tool must collect Macro economics indexes from the most used sources by this analyst (FED, Central Bank Brazil And Yahoo Finance). This tool guarantees the data veracity and treats data to be used in another system by using data manipulations and statistical techniques with Pandas library.

In order the help more, this tool also helps with the indexes tendency, being calculated using moving average for smoothing the time series and linear regression to indicate how agressive the tendency is.

[Air System Maintence -> Classification](https://github.com/guialveira-professional/Maintenance)

A Truck company has been having many problems about air system maintenance costs. The Company recently passed through a digitalization process and the maintenance data is incomplete. It was asked to build a machine learning model to predict which the maintenance nature using some variables storaged in the area's system. In this case there are just two types, posite or negative for the expensive type, the cost difference is 2000%.
The dataset columns name were encoded tho preserve the suppliers identity.

In this case it was necessary an extensive data treatment, there were lots of missing data and the classes were unbalanced due the recent digitalization process. The prediction provided 75% cutback on expensive air system maintenances.

[Beer/Temperature -> Statistics](https://github.com/guialveira-professional/Statistics_time_series)

This one is a personal projects using only statistics tools to predict beer's sazonality and temperature outlier detection using moving average techniques

[Sales Forecasting -> Time Series RNN](https://www.kaggle.com/code/guialveira/sales-forecast)

A chain of stores wanted to predict how much in sales will it take along the time. The datasets provided were splitted in diffent documents. In this case it was necessary to merge all the datasets getting the needed precautions to maintain the data veracity over time.

A Recurrent Neural Network was developed using LSTM Layers int TensorFlow to predict how much in sales this chain of stores will get. I was able to achive 0.127 of Root Mean Logarithmic Error(RMSLE).

[ERP System -> API Development](https://github.com/guialveira-professional/Sistema_ERP)

<img src="https://www.cxtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/erp-system-850.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

The whole backend to a ERP System developed using Django, MySQL. This system allows companies to manage employees, permissions and tasks, can be used by the employees to see the tasks designed to then and when it's allow by the owner specific employees can add tasks to the system.
It has a signin and signup functions and the passwords are hashed using Simple JTW tokenization

The Databese architecture was developed using the first 3 normal forms to deal with vectorized and multivaluated fields
